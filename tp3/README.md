## TP 3 Notes

- Before the first exercise we started by familiarising ourselves with controlling the lights and seeing their effects on the different pre-made materials.
- In the first exercise we hard-coded the extra necessary vertices and respective normals for our previously made unit-cube to be properly illuminated.
- We also created a new custom material to replicate the appearence of wood, as well as extra colored materials innate to the tangram class to be used by each of the primitives in it, to finish replicating the image supplied in the first class.

- In the second exercice we created a new prism class with dynamically generated vertices, indices and normals according to values supplied to the object constructor for the number of slices and stacks.
- It was not necessary to create a specific display function for the prism, nor to perform any transformations.
