## TP 2 Notes

- In the first exercise we created a simple tangram by applying transformations (rotations and translations) to the elements we have used in the last practical class. Then, we created a class named MyTangram, to tidy things up. This way, our code was easier to understand and work with.

- In the second exercise, we created a 3D cube, and used it as a base for the tangram, as we can observe in the picture below.

- In the third exercise, we substituted the previous cube with a cube composed by 6 squares from the MyQuad class, each one representing each face of the cube. We can observe that, using this new cube, we can distinguish the several faces of the cube and the edges, which we couldn't do very well in the last exercise.
