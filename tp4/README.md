## TP 4 Notes

- We started this worksheet by experimenting with the scene controls for manipulating the texture applied to the predefined quad object.

- In the first exercise we applied texture coordinates for each piece of the tangram, creating new classes for the repeated pieces with different colours, following the same structure as the existing quad object.

- In the second exercise, we created a minecraft block by applying textures to the UnitCubeQuad created in the previous classes.
